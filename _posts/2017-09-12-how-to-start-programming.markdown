Because now the world requires us not just to have a job, but to also blog about it. Thus I add here a simple setup...
Hello World! :)

>The common practice of keeping up appearances with society is a mere selfish struggle of the vain with the vain. - John Ruskin
>There are no grades of vanity, there are only grades of ability in concealing it. ~ Mark Twain, 1898
>Vanity is the quicksand of reason. ~ George Sand
